✅ Employee Feedback Data Analysis Project

🧩 Overview

In this project the employee feedback is being collated in a SharePoint list used with PowerApps. We aim to obtain insights into:


✅ Employee satisfaction

🤖 System friendliness

-🔁 Interest in continued use of the product/service

🛠️ Frequently asked questions and feature requests


📁 Data Source

Source:** SharePoint list which records employee feedback submissions.

🧹 Data Preparation

SP Data exported as raw data to CSV.

Clean the data with Power BI Power Query Editor:

🔄 Replaced inconsistent data formatting (e.g. “4 – Likely” ➡️ “4”)

🚫 Filled missing data with "No response" 

🧽 Unified text fields & Harmonized rating scales

🛠️ Data Modeling / Visualisation

-Developed DAX calculated columns to segment the responses and for better analysis.
- Handled missing values, cleaned data, and standardized inputs.
- Utilizing these improvements, clear insights were obtained by creating visuals such as word clouds and bar charts.

## 🔍 Perspectives 
  - 📈 Recognized important patterns like: - Most prevalent problem types
  -Overall levels of satisfaction
  -Relationships between friendliness and propensity to stick around 
  - ⚠️ Note: The analysis has **limitations** because
  -The sample size is small (new app).
  -Anonymized answers


## 🙠️ Using This Repository: 
- Open the **Power BI `.pbix`** file to explore interactively;
- Refer to the **CSV** file to view raw data  

## Future Projects  
1. Use a Power BI connector to automate the import of data from SharePoint.  
2. Improve feature request analysis with **text mining/NLP**  
3. 📊 Extend dataset for more thorough and trustworthy insights  
4. Enhance the Power BI dashboard with drill-down and filtering features.
